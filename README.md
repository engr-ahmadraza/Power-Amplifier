This is a simple Electronics Project named Power Amplifier. It is voltage divider biased circuit. In this circuit Transistor, Capacitors, Resistors and Diodes are involved. It is a multistage common emitter and power amplifier.
The input signal is applied to a common emitter configuration, which inverts and amplifies the signal. The output is obtained after passing through multiple amplification stages, including power transistors, which further amplify the signal and provide the final amplified output across the load resistor.
